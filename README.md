This readme file is about ResNet50 model which is trained and tested on MRi kaggle dataset, with custom weights, arrucary obtained about 98%, this repo dosen't contain the the actuall tain and test envirnoment, but worked on the same trained model in differnt colab envirnment for ame dataset which is imported as a json format in here!

ABOUT THE JOURNEY IN WORKING ON THE ASSIGMENT.

Due to the limited time available, I leveraged a preprocessed dataset from Kaggle to streamline data preparation and focus on model development. While working on this assignment, I utilized my prior knowledge and reinforced my understanding through resources like ChatGPT and YouTube. Given my background in engineering, I found revisiting deep learning frameworks and libraries exciting and was eager to dive deeper.

I implemented a classification model to detect tumors using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and experimented with different architectures by adjusting the number of dense layers. For segmentation, I employed a ResUNet model to localize tumors, ensuring efficient training within the given time constraints here i took a lot of help from opensource and other sources.

Despite these constraints, I successfully trained and validated both classification and segmentation models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-driven neuroimaging analysis. This project reaffirmed my enthusiasm for deep learning and AI in medical imaging, and I am eager to explore and refine these techniques further.
